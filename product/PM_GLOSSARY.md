## PM Communication Patterns

### **When to Say What**:
- "Let's validate that assumption" (instead of assuming)
- "What problem are we solving?" (focus on user needs)
- "How will we measure success?" (define success criteria)
- "What's the impact vs effort?" (prioritization thinking)
- "Let's gather more data" (evidence-based decisions)

### **Phrases That Show PM Thinking**:
- "Trade-offs" - Every decision has costs
- "Prioritization" - Not everything can be #1
- "User-centric" - Decisions based on user value
- "Data-driven" - Decisions based on evidence
- "Iterative" - Build, measure, learn, repeat
